        The most important thing we've learned,<br>
        So far as children are concerned,<br>
        Is never, NEVER, NEVER let<br>
        Them near your television set --<br>
        Or better still, just don't install<br>
        The idiotic thing at all.<br>
        In almost every house we've been,<br>
        We've watched them gaping at the screen.<br>
        They loll and slop and lounge about,<br>
        And stare until their eyes pop out.<br>
        (Last week in someone's place we saw<br>
        A dozen eyeballs on the floor.)<br>
        They sit and stare and stare and sit<br>
        Until they're hypnotised by it,<br>
        Until they're absolutely drunk<br>
        With all that shocking ghastly junk.<br>
        Oh yes, we know it keeps them still,<br>
        They don't climb out the window sill,<br>
        They never fight or kick or punch,<br>
        They leave you free to cook the lunch<br>
        And wash the dishes in the sink --<br>
        But did you ever stop to think,<br>
        To wonder just exactly what<br>
        This does to your beloved tot?<br>
        IT ROTS THE SENSE IN THE HEAD!<br>
        IT KILLS IMAGINATION DEAD!<br>
        IT CLOGS AND CLUTTERS UP THE MIND!<br>
        IT MAKES A CHILD SO DULL AND BLIND<br>
        HE CAN NO LONGER UNDERSTAND<br>
        A FANTASY, A FAIRYLAND!<br>
        HIS BRAIN BECOMES AS SOFT AS CHEESE!<br>
        HIS POWERS OF THINKING RUST AND FREEZE!<br>
        HE CANNOT THINK -- HE ONLY SEES!<br>
        'All right!' you'll cry. 'All right!' you'll say,<br>
        'But if we take the set away,<br>
        What shall we do to entertain<br>
        Our darling children? Please explain!'<br>
        We'll answer this by asking you,<br>
        'What used the darling ones to do?<br>
        'How used they keep themselves contented<br>
        Before this monster was invented?'<br>
        Have you forgotten? Don't you know?<br>
        We'll say it very loud and slow:<br>
        THEY ... USED ... TO ... READ! They'd READ and READ,<br>
        AND READ and READ, and then proceed<br>
        To READ some more. Great Scott! Gadzooks!<br>
        One half their lives was reading books!<br>
        The nursery shelves held books galore!<br>
        Books cluttered up the nursery floor!<br>
        And in the bedroom, by the bed,<br>
        More books were waiting to be read!<br>
        Such wondrous, fine, fantastic tales<br>
        Of dragons, gypsies, queens, and whales<br>
        And treasure isles, and distant shores<br>
        Where smugglers rowed with muffled oars,<br>
        And pirates wearing purple pants,<br>
        And sailing ships and elephants,<br>
        And cannibals crouching 'round the pot,<br>
        Stirring away at something hot.<br>
        (It smells so good, what can it be?<br>
        Good gracious, it's Penelope.)<br>
        The younger ones had Beatrix Potter<br>
        With Mr. Tod, the dirty rotter,<br>
        And Squirrel Nutkin, Pigling Bland,<br>
        And Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle and-<br>
        Just How The Camel Got His Hump,<br>
        And How the Monkey Lost His Rump,<br>
        And Mr. Toad, and bless my soul,<br>
        There's Mr. Rat and Mr. Mole-<br>
        Oh, books, what books they used to know,<br>
        Those children living long ago!<br>
        So please, oh please, we beg, we pray,<br>
        Go throw your TV set away,<br>
        And in its place you can install<br>
        A lovely bookshelf on the wall.<br>
        Then fill the shelves with lots of books,<br>
        Ignoring all the dirty looks,<br>
        The screams and yells, the bites and kicks,<br>
        And children hitting you with sticks-<br>
        Fear not, because we promise you<br>
        That, in about a week or two<br>
        Of having nothing else to do,<br>
        They'll now begin to feel the need<br>
        Of having something to read.<br>
        And once they start -- oh boy, oh boy!<br>
        You watch the slowly growing joy<br>
        That fills their hearts. They'll grow so keen<br>
        They'll wonder what they'd ever seen<br>
        In that ridiculous machine,<br>
        That nauseating, foul, unclean,<br>
        Repulsive television screen!<br>
        And later, each and every kid<br>
        Will love you more for what you did.<br>
