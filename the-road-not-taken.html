      Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br>
      And sorry I could not travel both<br>
      And be one traveler, long I stood<br>
      And looked down one as far as I could<br>
      To where it bent in the undergrowth;<br>
      <br>
      Then took the other, as just as fair,<br>
      And having perhaps the better claim<br>
      Because it was grassy and wanted wear,<br>
      Though as for that the passing there<br>
      Had worn them really about the same,<br>
      <br>
      And both that morning equally lay<br>
      In leaves no step had trodden black.<br>
      Oh, I kept the first for another day!<br>
      Yet knowing how way leads on to way<br>
      I doubted if I should ever come back.<br>
      <br>
      I shall be telling this with a sigh<br>
      Somewhere ages and ages hence:<br>
      Two roads diverged in a wood, and I,<br>
      I took the one less traveled by,<br>
      And that has made all the difference.<br>
